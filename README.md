# Integrating Bi-directional "Meet in the Middle" Search into the Pacman Domain

In this team project, a team of four used the "Bidirectional Search That Is Guaranteed to Meet in the Middle" paper by Robert C. Holte, Ariel Felner, Guni Sharon and Nathan R. Sturtevant (AAAI 2016) to create two bidirectional search algorithms in the Pacman domain, MM and MM0.

The collaborators for this project are Harangopal Jawahar (hjawahar@asu.edu), Navyasri Mallu (nmallu@asu.edu), Pratyusha Musunuru (pmusunu1@asu.edu), and Sahil Patel (smpate11@asu.edu).
