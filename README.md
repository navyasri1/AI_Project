# Integrating Bi-directional "Meet in the Middle" Search into the Pacman Domain

In this team project, a team of four used the "Bidirectional Search That Is Guaranteed to Meet in the Middle" paper by Robert C. Holte, Ariel Felner, Guni Sharon and Nathan R. Sturtevant (AAAI 2016) to create two bidirectional search algorithms in the Pacman domain, MM and MM0.

The collaborators for this project are Harangopal Jawahar (hjawahar@asu.edu), Navyasri Mallu (nmallu@asu.edu), Pratyusha Musunuru (pmusunu1@asu.edu), and Sahil Patel (smpate11@asu.edu).


Instructions to run the code:

python all_layout_run.py which runs 15 layouts for all the algorithms, gives t-test results and saves the results into all_layout_output.csv

python selected_layout_run.py which runs different variants of three layouts 'mediumMaze','mediumCorners','trickySearch', runs t-tests and saves the results into mediumCorners_output.csv, mediumMaze_output.csv, trickySearch_output.csv

Different variants of layouts are saved in layouts_selective folder.

Requirements to run the code :
